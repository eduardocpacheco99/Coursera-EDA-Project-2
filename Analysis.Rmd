## Loading libraries
1. We will add all libraries to our project

```{r}
library('dplyr')
library('ggplot2')
library('scales')
library('data.table')
```
## Inputting Data
2. Download the .rds file  [here] using download.file (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip)

3.unzip file using unzip() function


```{r}
url <- 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip'
download.file(url, destfile='EDA_P2.zip')
unzip('EDA_P2.zip')

```
4. Read NEI( National Emissions Inventory)(SummarySSC PM 25) and SSC (Source Classification Code)
```{r}
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")
```

## Data Exploration 
We will begin our analysis exploring NEI data. We have a data frame with all PM2.5 emissions for 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008.  For each year we get all emissions of a Pollutant.

```{r}
head(NEI)
tail(NEI)
```


Now lets see the types of data on each column

```{r}
str(NEI)
```
OMG, 64.9 milions of observations. 

*fips: A five-digit number (represented as a string) indicating the U.S. county
*SCC: The name of the source as indicated by a digit string (see source code classification table)
*Pollutant: A string indicating the pollutant
*Emission: Amount of PM2.5 emitted, in tons
*type: The type of source (point, non-point, on-road, or non-road)
*year: The year of emissions recorded

Now let's loot the SSC table. This table links SSC digit strings in Emissions table to the actuall name of PM2.5 source. Also, this source get a category in few different ways (more general to more specific) and you may choose to explore the categories you think is better. 

```{r}
head(SCC)
tail(SCC)
```

Lets call str on SSC to see the df structure
```{r}
str(SCC)
```

#QUestion 1 : Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in US from 1999 to 2008?
... Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

Answer: yes.
To answer this, we first make a data.frame called annual that uses dplyr group_by, filter, and summarize to add up the tons of emissions for each of the four years. Then we make a numeric vector called pts by dividing the annual emissions by 1,000,000 so that we can plot the annual totals in millions of tons. We then call plot with the arguments below. Of note, we divide the y-value by 1,000,000 to be consistent with the y-axis labels. Also, we set axes = FALSE the call to plot because we are going to manually plot them later. The calls to axis(1) and axis(2...) plots the x- and y-axes respectively and specifies the locations of the tick marks (equal to yrs and pts) and for the y-axis creates the labels by appending an M (for millions) using paste.
```{r}
annual <- NEI %>% group_by(year) %>% 
  filter(year == 1999|2002|2005|2008) %>% 
  summarize(Annual.Total = sum(Emissions));
pts <- pretty(annual$Annual.Total/1000000);
yrs <- c(1999,2002,2005,2008)
plot(annual$year, annual$Annual.Total/1000000, type = "l", lwd = 2, axes = FALSE,
     xlab = "Year", 
     ylab = expression("Total Tons of PM"[2.5]*" Emissions"), 
     main = expression("Total Tons of PM"[2.5]*" Emissions in the United States"));
axis(1, at = yrs, labels = paste(yrs));
axis(2, at = pts, labels = paste(pts, "M", sep = ""));
box()

```

The plot shows PM2.5 emissions decreased in US from 2008 to 1999.

#Question 2: Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == “24510”) from 1999 to 2008?
... "Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question."

Answer: Yes. 
```{r}
baltimore <- NEI %>% 
  filter(fips == "24510") %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(Annual.Total = sum(Emissions));
baltimore.pts <- pretty(baltimore$Annual.Total/1000);
plot(baltimore$year, baltimore$Annual.Total/1000, type = "l", lwd = 2, axes = FALSE,
     xlab = "Year", 
     ylab = expression("Total Tons of PM"[2.5]*" Emissions"), 
     main = expression("Total Tons of PM"[2.5]*" Emissions in Baltimore"));
axis(1, at = c(1999,2002,2005,2008))
axis(2, at = baltimore.pts, labels = paste(baltimore.pts, "K", sep = ""));
box()

```

#Q3: Of the four types of sources indicated by the 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? 
... "Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question."

A: on-road, non-road, and non-point sources have all seen decreases in PM2.5 emissions from 1999-2008 whereas point sources have seen an increase over the same time period.

```{r}
nei.baltimore <- NEI %>% filter(fips == "24510") %>% group_by(type, year) %>% summarize(Annual.Total = sum(Emissions));
nei.baltimore$type <- factor(nei.baltimore$type, levels = c("ON-ROAD", "NON-ROAD", "POINT", "NONPOINT")) # Re-order factor levels so they plot in the order we wish

#Q6: Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == “𝟶𝟼𝟶𝟹𝟽”). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

A: Baltimore City as seen a negative 8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in emissions from motor vehicles over the 9 years of data whereas Los Angeles has experienced a positive 0.5% CAGR over the same period. The data indicate that motor vehicle emissions have declined in Baltimore City and increased in Los Angeles.

Ok, not clear which has greater change in percent. We will use data.table function cakked shift to help us to calculate percent change.

```{r}
nei.vehicles.DT <- data.table(nei.vehicles)
yoyFunc <- function(x) {x/shift(x)}
yoy.cols <- c("Annual.Total")
nei.vehicles.DT <- nei.vehicles.DT[, paste0("Percent.Change.", yoy.cols) := lapply(.SD, yoyFunc), by = "fips,SCC.Level.Two", .SDcols = yoy.cols]
nei.vehicles.DT <- mutate(nei.vehicles.DT, Percent.Change.Annual.Total = Percent.Change.Annual.Total - 1)
ggplot(nei.vehicles.DT, aes(x = factor(year), y = Percent.Change.Annual.Total, fill = SCC.Level.Two)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_grid(fips ~ SCC.Level.Two) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab(expression("% Change From Prior Measurement")) + 
  ggtitle(expression(atop("Percentage Change in Total Tons of PM"[2.5]*" Emissions from Motor Vehicle", paste("Sources in Baltimore City, MD and Los Angeles County, CA")))) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + # Center the plot title
  theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1,1,1,1), "cm")) + # Adjust plot margins
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
```

 Baltimore City appears to have a more meaningful decline in PM2.5 emissions from motor vehicle sources than Los Angeles County. It is tempting to use use summary to look at the Percent.Change.Annual.Total in each location to find the average Percent.Change.Annual.Total; however, this is not correct. The correct way to do this is to calculate the growth rate, defined as: 
[[Ending Quantity - Beginning Quantity/Number of Years]÷Beginning Quantity]×100
```{r}

```

We can do this easily using dplyr.

```{r}
CAGR.df <- nei.vehicles.DT %>% 
  group_by(fips, SCC.Level.Two) %>% 
  summarize(N.Years = max(year) - min(year), 
            Beginning.Qty = Annual.Total[which(year==min(year))],
            Ending.Qty = Annual.Total[which(year==max(year))],
            CAGR = ((Ending.Qty-Beginning.Qty)/N.Years)/Beginning.Qty)
CAGR.df
```

As we can see from using summary below, the annual growth rate is overstated by taking a simple mean of the Percent.Change.Annual.Total. First for Baltimore:
```{r}
summary(nei.vehicles.DT$Percent.Change.Annual.Total[nei.vehicles.DT$fips=="Baltimore"])
```
Lets use the same for Los Angeles

```{r}
summary(nei.vehicles.DT$Percent.Change.Annual.Total[nei.vehicles.DT$fips=="Los Angeles"])
```
